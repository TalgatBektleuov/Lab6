SELECT city_id, MAX(total), previous.store_id
FROM address
JOIN (SELECT store.store_id, SUM(amount) AS total, store.address_id
  FROM customer 
  JOIN payment ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
  JOIN store ON customer.store_id = store.store_id
  WHERE payment_date BETWEEN TO_DATE('2007-04-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD') AND TO_DATE('2007-05-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
  GROUP BY (store.store_id)) 
    AS previous ON address.address_id = previous.address_id
GROUP BY(city_id, previous.store_id)

Again, let's create an index

CREATE INDEX idx_2nd_query
	 ON address USING btree
	 (city_id ASC NULLS LAST);
